These\r\nteams must identify and defend against various security threats via the Competition network.\r\n\r\n* Red Team - Comprised of professionals from the Information Assurance community playing the\r\nrole of hackers.  This team must create and implement various attack strategies against the Blue\r\nTeams, and capture flags from the Blue Team servers.\r\n\r\n* White Team - Comprised of respected individuals from the Information Assurance community.\r\nThis team is the judging authority for the CDC.\r\n\r\n* Green Team - This team consists of members with various computer familiarity and skill levels.\r\nThey play the role of typical network users.  The Green Team duties include regular Internet\r\nusage and the execution of predefined anomalies.\r\n\r\n## Terms Glossery ([from the Offical Iowa State Documention](https://www.iac.iastate.edu/wiki/File:ITOCDC12-Rules.pdf))\r\n* Flag - a ncrypted file placed in a predefined location.  The Red Team much capture these\r\nflags from or plant them onto teamsâ€™ systems.\r\n\r\n* Anomalies - These events are injected into the system at various times throughout the\r\ncompetition.  The Anomalies are designed to test, or simply just complicate, the Blue Team\r\nduties during the competition.  \r\n\r\n* CDC Director - Oversees the operation of the CDC, leads the White\r\nTeam in scoring and adjudication, and coordinates the Red, Green, and Blue Teams.\r\n\r\n## IScorE-rails Terms\r\n* Document - A documention for the White and Green Teams or other purposes.\r\n\r\n* Anomalies - A optional, or not, chanllages made by the Green Team Leader. This will give Blue Teams additanal points.\r\n\r\n* Green Team Usability Reports: These are manully checks by the Green Team to test the Blue Teams'\r\n  Services. These forms will need changed for each year of your CDC.\r\n  The IScorE-rails will use the 2012 IT-Adventures Cyber Defense. The checks\r\n  have check boxs. You check if the service is up and don't if it isn't. It\r\n  is also recommend to add a comment about each outage.\r\n\r\n## Flags\r\n* Flags are made by Competion Director. The Read Team will marks theses flags as captured when the discover them.\r\n  The will enter the flag into the text field on the flag page for later verifition. \r\n\r\n* Also if the Red Team is able to capture the flag the Blue Team can send a report back, via a text\r\n  field, to able back points, up to half. These will be judged by the Red and White teams.\r\n  \r\n#### Schema\r\n##### Flag (`flag`)\r\n* `name`\r\n\t* required\r\n \t* `string`\r\n  \t* Name of Flag \r\n   \t* Examples\r\n\t\t* SSH - Read\r\n  \t\t* SSH -
