These\r\nteams must identify and defend against various security threats via the Competition network.\r\n\r\n* Red Team - Comprised of professionals from the Information Assurance community playing the\r\nrole of hackers.  This team must create and implement various attack strategies against the Blue\r\nTeams, and capture flags from the Blue Team servers.\r\n\r\n* White Team - Comprised of respected individuals from the Information Assurance community.\r\nThis team is the judging authority for the CDC.\r\n\r\n* Green Team - This team consists of members with various computer familiarity and skill levels.\r\nThey play the role of typical network users.  The Green Team duties include regular Internet\r\nusage and the execution of predefined anomalies.\r\n\r\n## Terms Glossery ([from the Offical Iowa State Documention](https://www.iac.iastate.edu/wiki/File:ITOCDC12-Rules.pdf))\r\n* Flag - a ncrypted file placed in a predefined location.  The Red Team much capture these\r\nflags from or plant them onto teamsâ€™ systems.\r\n\r\n* Anomalies - These events are injected into the system at various times throughout the\r\ncompetition.  The Anomalies are designed to test, or simply just complicate, the Blue Team\r\nduties during the competition.  \r\n\r\n* CDC Director - Oversees the operation of the CDC, leads the White\r\nTeam in scoring and adjudication, and coordinates the Red, Green, and Blue Teams.\r\n\r\n## IScorE-rails Terms\r\n* Document - A documention for the White and Green Teams or other purposes.\r\n\r\n* Anomalies - A optional, or not, chanllages made by the Green Team Leader. This will give Blue Teams additanal points.\r\n\r\n* Green Team Usability Reports: These are manully checks by the Green Team to test the Blue Teams'\r\n  Services. These forms will need changed for each year of your CDC.\r\n  The IScorE-rails will use the 2012 IT-Adventures Cyber Defense. The checks\r\n  have check boxs. You check if the service is up and don't if it isn't. It\r\n  is also recommend to add a comment about each outage.\r\n\r\n## Flags\r\n* Flags are made by Competion Director. The Read Team will marks theses flags as captured when the discover them.\r\n  The will enter the flag into the text field on the flag page for later verifition. \r\n\r\n* Also if the Red Team is able to capture the flag the Blue Team can send a report back, via a text\r\n  field, to able back points, up to half. These will be judged by the Red and White teams.\r\n\r\n## Intrusion Reports\r\n* Intrusion reports are periodic reports that are submitted by the Blue Teams. \r\n\r\n* This report is where the teams will tell what isn't or is happening with there networks and services.\r\n\r\n* These are juged by the White Team\r\n\r\n* Only one report per reporting period.\r\n\r\n## Green Team Usability Reports\r\n* Started by Green Team Leader\r\n\r\n* Then Started only Green Team Memebers can see theses scores and edit theme\r\n\r\n* The score will be released to Blue Teams after all reports are done and \r\n  the scores are released by Green Team Leader\r\n\r\n## Anomalies\r\n* Created by the Green Team Leader\r\n\r\n* Done by the Blue Team \r\n\r\n* Juged by the Green Team Leaders and/ or members\r\n\r\n## Documentaion\r\n* Created by Blue Teams\r\n\r\n* Used by Green and White Teams, or others as you see fit\r\n\r\n* Juged by Green and White Teams, again as you see fit\r\n\r\n## Perimisions\r\n* Each User has a Team membership to a team. \r\n\r\n* It will be to one of the following:\r\n  - Blue \r\n  - Green\r\n  - Red\r\n  - White\r\n  - Admin: Access to all teams\r\n\r\n* If the user is one of red, green, blue, or white teams he or she will only be able \r\n  to access that area of ISorE-rails.\r\n\r\n* On the Blue Team Users only see their teams items during the allowed time\r\n\r\n* Admins have access to all\r\n\r\n* These are defined in `app/models/ability.rb`.\r\n\r\n* Authorization is done by [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/) by [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb)\r\n\r\n* Authentication is handle, by default, is username and password model.

If you where checking Site 1 it would be 1\r\n\r\n  - `service_name_id` The id of the service that is being checked. These are stored in the services model. \r\n  the ids are listed in the admin sectiaon.\r\n\r\n  - `status` This is must be 0 or 1. 0 for being down. 1 for being up.\r\n\r\n  - `auth_token` The API token (see the API section for more deatils)\r\n\r\n## API\r\n* Some of the functions of IScorE are accessable and/ or use the API to the task they were designed to do.\r\n\r\n* To use the API use must be a member of the admin team.\r\n\r\n* There is ONE, API key for the whole App.\r\n\r\n* If you reset the API token **YOU WILL BREAK EVERYTHING THAT USES IT. YES, REALLY**. \r\n\r\n* If you are using the service scanner and change API token **YOU WILL BREAK IT**\r\n\r\n* If you are using an third party service and change the API token **YOU WILL** break things\r\n\r\n\r\n* The API is versioned currenly we are on version 1 (one) of the api.\r\n\r\n* The API can be found at `(IScorE_host)/api/v1/`\r\n\r\n## Scoring\r\n* Scoring is the very heart of IScorE-rails\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
